## Knowledge Activation Principle

### What is Knowledge Activation?

Knowledge Activation is the core principle behind the Dr. Strunz Knowledge Base. It transforms static health information into actionable, contextual insights through intelligent retrieval and synthesis.

```

### How Knowledge Activation Works

1. **Semantic Encoding**
   - All content is transformed into 384-dimensional vectors
   - Captures meaning beyond keywords
   - Enables cross-language understanding (German/English)

2. **Contextual Retrieval**
   - User queries activate relevant knowledge clusters
   - FAISS enables millisecond-speed similarity search
   - Multiple sources provide comprehensive perspectives

3. **Intelligent Synthesis**
   - MCP server combines related information
   - Preserves Dr. Strunz's medical expertise
   - Delivers coherent, actionable responses

### Benefits of Knowledge Activation

| Traditional Search | Activated Knowledge |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Keyword matching | Semantic understanding |
| Single results | Synthesized insights |
| Static information | Contextual recommendations |

## Deployment

### Local Development

#### Running Locally

```bash
# Start the MCP server locally
python -m src.mcp.server

# Or with environment variables
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG MCP_SERVER_HOST=localhost python -m src.mcp.server

# Run with specific port
PORT=8080 python -m src.mcp.server
```

#### Local Docker Development

# Run locally with volume mounting
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG \
  strunz-knowledge

# Docker Compose for local development
docker-compose up -d
```

### Production Deployment (Railway)

#### Railway Configuration

The project is configured for deployment on Railway with automatic builds and deployments.

**Railway Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Required
PORT=8000                    # Railway provides this
MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0      # Bind to all interfaces
LOG_LEVEL=INFO               # Production logging
VECTOR_DB_TYPE=faiss         # Vector database type

# Optional
WORKERS=4                    # Number of worker processes
MAX_REQUESTS=1000            # Max requests per worker
KEEP_ALIVE=5                 # Keep-alive timeout
```

#### Railway Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository**
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Link project
   railway link
   ```

2. **Configure Service**
   ```toml
   # railway.toml
   [build]
   builder = "dockerfile"
   dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"
   
   [deploy]
   startCommand = "python -m src.mcp.server"
   restartPolicyType = "always"
   healthcheckPath = "/"
   healthcheckTimeout = 10
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to Railway
   railway up
   
   # Check deployment status
   railway status
   
   # View logs
   railway logs
   ```

### Railway Production Deployment

#### Base URL
```
https://strunz-knowledge.up.railway.app
```

#### MCP Server Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Health check |
| `/mcp` | POST | MCP tool calls |
| `/sse` | GET | Server-sent events |

#### Health Check

```bash
# Verify deployment
curl https://strunz-knowledge.up.railway.app/
```

**Note**: This is an MCP server deployment, not a public API. Access is through MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Railway Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --build

# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Force rebuild
railway up --detach
```

#### 2. FAISS Index Errors
```python
# Rebuild index
python src/scripts/rebuild_index.py --source all

# Verify index integrity
python src/scripts/verify_index.py
```

#### 3. Memory Issues
```bash
# Increase Railway memory limit
railway variables set MEMORY_LIMIT=4096

# Use chunked processing
PROCESS_CHUNK_SIZE=1000 python src/rag/news_processor.py
```

### Debug Mode

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Debug search queries
from src.debug import debug_search
debug_search("test query", verbose=True)
```
