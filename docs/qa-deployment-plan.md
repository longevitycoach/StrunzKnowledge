# QA Deployment Plan - Production Readiness

## Environment Parity Issues Identified

### Critical Discrepancies
1. **Version Mismatch**: Production (v0.8.0) vs Local (v0.9.0)
2. **Server Implementation**: Production using deleted `unified_mcp_server.py`
3. **Docker Build Cache**: Not reflecting latest changes
4. **Port Configuration**: railway.toml vs actual deployment (8000 vs 8080)

### Configuration Drift Analysis
- **Requirements**: Production using old requirements files
- **Entry Points**: Different servers between local/production
- **Health Checks**: Inconsistent endpoint configurations
- **Environment Variables**: Missing Railway-specific overrides

## QA Testing Matrix

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation

#### 1.1 Local Environment Testing
- [ ] HTTP transport starts successfully (`TRANSPORT=http python main.py`)
- [ ] Stdio transport works (`python main.py` default)
- [ ] Health check returns v0.9.0
- [ ] All 24 tools load correctly
- [ ] Vector store preloads (43,373 documents)
- [ ] OAuth endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] SSE endpoint handles connections

#### 1.2 Docker Environment Testing
- [ ] Build succeeds with unified requirements
- [ ] Container runs with correct entry point
- [ ] Health checks pass in container
- [ ] Port binding works correctly
- [ ] Environment variables propagate

- [ ] Vector search returns accurate results
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

### Phase 3: Production Monitoring & Observability

#### 3.1 Health Monitoring
- [ ] Endpoint monitoring (/health, /railway-health)
- [ ] Response time baselines established
- [ ] Error rate thresholds configured
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] CPU utilization monitoring

#### 3.2 Functional Monitoring
- [ ] MCP tool execution monitoring
- [ ] Vector search performance metrics
- [ ] OAuth authentication success rates
- [ ] SSE connection stability
- [ ] Claude.ai integration status

#### 3.3 Business Logic Validation
- [ ] Dr. Strunz knowledge retrieval accuracy
- [ ] Supplement protocol generation works
- [ ] Health assessment tools functional
- [ ] Community insights aggregation
- [ ] Newsletter evolution analysis

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High Risk Items
1. **FAISS Index Corruption**: Backup and verification procedures
2. **Memory Exhaustion**: Resource limits and monitoring
3. **Authentication Failures**: OAuth fallback mechanisms
4. **Network Connectivity**: Timeout and retry logic

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Version Drift**: Automated version checking
2. **Configuration Mismatch**: Environment validation
3. **Tool Failures**: Individual tool health checks
4. **Performance Degradation**: Baseline comparisons

### Low Risk Items
1. **UI/UX Issues**: Non-blocking cosmetic problems
2. **Documentation Lag**: Updated post-deployment
3. **Logging Verbosity**: Adjustable via environment

## Automated Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Individual MCP tool functionality

- [ ] Memory usage under load
- [ ] Vector search response times
- [ ] Tool execution performance
- [ ] Startup time optimization

### Security Tests
- [ ] OAuth security validation
