# Release Notes - v0.2.0

## 🚀 Dr. Strunz Knowledge Base MCP Server - Version 0.2.0

### Release Date: July 13, 2025

### 🎯 Overview

Version 0.2.0 introduces significant security enhancements, production-ready deployment configurations, and comprehensive testing infrastructure. This release focuses on implementing proper MCP protocol isolation while providing necessary monitoring capabilities for Railway deployment.

### ✨ Major Features

#### 1. **Pure MCP Server Implementation** 🔒
- Created `pure_mcp_server.py` using FastMCP protocol only
- No public HTTP API endpoints for data access
- All knowledge base queries require MCP protocol authentication
- Implements 5 core MCP tools with more in development

#### 2. **SSE Endpoint for Monitoring** 📊
- Added Server-Sent Events endpoint at `/sse` for Railway monitoring
- Provides real-time heartbeat events every 30 seconds
- Reports server status, MCP tools count, and vector store availability
- Essential for integration testing and health monitoring

#### 3. **Enhanced Security Architecture** 🛡️
- Removed all public data endpoints
- MCP communication via stdio protocol only
- Health check at `/` is the only public HTTP endpoint
- SSE endpoint provides monitoring without data exposure

#### 4. **Comprehensive Test Infrastructure** 🧪
- Created `test_mcp_jsonrpc.sh` for JSON-RPC protocol testing
- Added `test_sse_endpoint.sh` for SSE functionality verification
- Documented test results showing 84.2% success rate with full server
- Average response time: 16ms for MCP tool calls

#### 5. **Sentence-Transformers Analysis** 🧠
- Confirmed usage for both initial processing AND real-time queries
- Model: `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` (384 dimensions)
- Memory usage: ~2GB for optimal semantic search
- Superior search quality for medical/health content

### 🔧 Breaking Changes
- Removed `/mcp` HTTP endpoint (now stdio only)
- Changed default server from `start_server.py` to `railway_mcp_sse_server.py`
- SSE endpoint required for Railway monitoring

### 🚀 Deployment Instructions

#### Docker Build & Run
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t strunz-mcp:0.2.0 .

# Run locally
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name strunz-mcp strunz-mcp:0.2.0

# Test health check
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Test SSE endpoint
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:8000/sse
```

#### Railway Deployment
- Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
- Health checks configured for 30-second intervals
- SSE endpoint available for monitoring
- MCP protocol ready for AI assistant integration

### 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Test Success Rate**: 84.2% (16/19 tools)
- **Average Response Time**: 16ms
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB with sentence-transformers
- **Startup Time**: 10-20 seconds

### 🔮 Future Roadmap
- Complete implementation of remaining 14 MCP tools
- Add caching layer for frequent queries
- Implement horizontal scaling support
- Enhance monitoring with Prometheus metrics
