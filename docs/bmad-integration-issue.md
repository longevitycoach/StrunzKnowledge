# BMAD Method Integration for StrunzKnowledge (Brownfield Approach)

## Overview
Implement the BMAD (Business Methodology for AI Development) method for the StrunzKnowledge project to enhance AI-driven development workflows and improve context management across the existing brownfield codebase.

## Background
The StrunzKnowledge project is a mature MCP server implementation with existing technical debt and ongoing migration from FastMCP to the Official MCP SDK. The BMAD method provides a structured approach to managing complex brownfield projects through specialized AI agents and context-engineered development.

## Objectives
1. Integrate BMAD agentic planning workflow into existing development process
2. Leverage BMAD's context-engineering for the FastMCP elimination epic
3. Establish hyper-detailed story generation for complex migration tasks
4. Improve AI agent collaboration on brownfield technical debt resolution

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: BMAD Setup & Configuration
- [ ] Install BMAD Method tools and dependencies
- [ ] Configure AI agent templates for StrunzKnowledge context
- [ ] Adapt BMAD workflows to existing brownfield documentation structure
- [ ] Create initial project brief incorporating current state analysis

### Phase 2: Agentic Planning Integration
- [ ] Deploy Analyst Agent to review existing codebase and documentation
- [ ] Configure PM Agent to work with existing PRDs in `docs/brownfield-prd/`
- [ ] Setup Architect Agent with knowledge of current technical architecture
- [ ] Establish feedback loops between agents and human reviewers

### Phase 3: Context-Engineered Development
- [ ] Configure Scrum Master Agent for story generation
- [ ] Create story templates that include:
  - Current implementation context
  - Technical debt considerations
  - Migration path specifications
  - Comprehensive test requirements
- [ ] Integrate with existing GitHub project board

### Phase 4: Brownfield-Specific Adaptations
- [ ] Map BMAD workflows to existing documentation structure
- [ ] Create migration stories for FastMCP → Official MCP SDK (Epic #1)
- [ ] Establish patterns for incremental BMAD adoption
- [ ] Document lessons learned and best practices

## Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (for BMAD tooling)
- AI agent platform access (Gemini/CustomGPT)
- Existing brownfield documentation up to date
- GitHub project board configured

### Integration Points
1. **Documentation**: Integrate with `docs/brownfield-architecture/` and `docs/brownfield-prd/`
2. **Version Control**: Maintain BMAD artifacts in repository
3. **CI/CD**: Adapt BMAD outputs to existing deployment pipeline
4. **Testing**: Ensure BMAD-generated code follows test requirements

## Success Criteria
1. Successful generation of hyper-detailed stories for FastMCP migration
2. Improved context retention across development phases
3. Reduced planning inconsistency in complex migrations
4. Enhanced collaboration between human developers and AI agents
5. Measurable reduction in technical debt through systematic approach

## Implementation Timeline
- Week 1-2: Phase 1 (Setup & Configuration)
- Week 3-4: Phase 2 (Agentic Planning)
- Week 5-6: Phase 3 (Context-Engineered Development)
- Week 7-8: Phase 4 (Brownfield Adaptations)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Learning Curve**: Allocate time for team training on BMAD method
2. **Integration Complexity**: Start with small, isolated components
3. **Agent Reliability**: Maintain human oversight and validation
4. **Context Overflow**: Implement context management strategies

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Assign team members to BMAD training
3. Begin Phase 1 setup activities
4. Create detailed sprint plans for each phase
