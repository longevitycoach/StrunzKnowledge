# Vector Database Evaluation: FAISS vs AlloyDB

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: FAISS**

For the Strunz Knowledge Base application, FAISS is the clear choice due to its open-source nature, zero cost, excellent performance for our use case, and ability to run entirely within the application container without external dependencies.

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Cost-Effectiveness

**FAISS**
- ✅ Completely free and open-source (MIT License)
- ✅ No licensing fees or usage costs
- ✅ No infrastructure costs beyond the application server

**AlloyDB**
- ❌ Google Cloud managed service with ongoing costs
- ❌ Pricing based on vCPUs, memory, and storage
- ❌ Minimum cost ~$200-500/month for production workloads
- ❌ Additional network egress charges

**Winner: FAISS** - Zero cost vs significant monthly expenses

### 2. Performance

**FAISS**
- ✅ Extremely fast similarity search (milliseconds for millions of vectors)
- ✅ Optimized C++ implementation with SIMD instructions
- ✅ Multiple index types for different speed/accuracy tradeoffs
- ✅ Efficient memory usage with quantization options
- ✅ Perfect for our corpus size (~10k-100k documents)

**AlloyDB**
- ✅ Good performance for transactional workloads
- ⚠️ Vector search via pgvector extension is slower than dedicated solutions
- ❌ Not optimized specifically for similarity search
- ❌ Network latency adds overhead

**Winner: FAISS** - Purpose-built for vector similarity search

### 3. Deployment Requirements

**FAISS**
- ✅ Runs entirely in-process with the application
- ✅ No external services or dependencies
- ✅ Can be installed via pip alongside other Python packages
- ✅ Works in any container environment
- ✅ Index can be persisted to disk and loaded on startup

**AlloyDB**
- ❌ Requires Google Cloud account and setup
- ❌ Cannot run in the same container as the application
- ❌ Requires network connectivity to GCP
- ❌ Complex authentication and security setup
- ❌ Vendor lock-in to Google Cloud

**Winner: FAISS** - Meets the requirement of running in the same container

### 4. Features for RAG Applications

**FAISS**
- ✅ Multiple similarity metrics (L2, inner product, cosine)
- ✅ Efficient batch searching
- ✅ Support for filtering and metadata storage (with wrapper)
- ✅ GPU acceleration available if needed
- ✅ Easy integration with LangChain and other RAG frameworks

**AlloyDB**
- ✅ Full SQL capabilities for complex queries
- ✅ ACID transactions
- ⚠️ Vector search is an add-on, not core functionality
- ❌ Less flexible for pure similarity search use cases

**Winner: FAISS** - Better suited for RAG-specific requirements

### 5. Scalability

**FAISS**
- ✅ Scales to billions of vectors
- ✅ Distributed search possible with index sharding
- ✅ Can handle our expected corpus size easily
- ⚠️ Scaling requires manual implementation

**AlloyDB**
- ✅ Managed scaling by Google
- ✅ Automatic backups and high availability
- ❌ Overkill for our use case
- ❌ Scaling increases costs significantly

**Winner: Tie** - Both can scale, but FAISS is sufficient for our needs

## Implementation Decision

Based on the evaluation, **FAISS** is the recommended choice for the following reasons:

1. **Zero Cost**: Open-source solution with no ongoing expenses
2. **Superior Performance**: Purpose-built for vector similarity search
3. **Deployment Simplicity**: Runs in the same container as the application
4. **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained solution
5. **Perfect Fit**: Designed specifically for our use case

## FAISS Implementation Architecture

```
Application Container
├── FastMCP Server
├── FAISS Index Manager
│   ├── Index Creation
│   ├── Vector Storage
│   └── Similarity Search
├── Document Processor
│   ├── Text Chunking
│   └── Embedding Generation
└── Persistent Storage
    └── faiss_index.bin
```

The FAISS implementation will:
- Use `IndexFlatIP` or `IndexIVFFlat` for similarity search
- Store document metadata separately in a lightweight format
- Persist the index to disk for container restarts
- Load the entire index into memory for fast search
- Support incremental updates when new content is added
