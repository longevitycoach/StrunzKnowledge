# Day 1 Cleanup Summary - Issue #19

## Completed Actions

### 1. Project Backup ✅
- Created backup branch: `backup-before-cleanup-20250723`
- All current state preserved before cleanup

### 2. MCP Server Audit ✅
- **Documented all server usage patterns**
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: `unified_mcp_server.py` is currently in production (railway-deploy.py)
- **Safe removal**: `official_mcp_server.py` (unused duplicate)
- **Utility files analysis**: All have dependencies, cannot remove yet

### 3. Script Cleanup ✅
- **Archived deprecated scripts**:
  - `start_server.py` → `archive/deprecated-scripts/`
- **Preserved initialization scripts**: All data processing and setup scripts kept

### 4. Documentation Analysis ✅
- **Requirements.txt**: Already clean, no unused dependencies found
- **SCRIPTS.md**: Up to date with current structure
- **Archive strategy**: Created `archive/` directory structure

## Key Findings

### Cannot Remove (Active Dependencies)
1. `unified_mcp_server.py` - **CURRENTLY DEPLOYED IN PRODUCTION**
2. `enhanced_server.py` - Fallback server, multiple test dependencies
3. `claude_compatible_server.py` - Railway fallback, deployment scripts
4. `user_profiling.py` - Imported by enhanced_server.py
5. `lightweight_embeddings.py` - Used by vector_store.py
6. `mcp_input_parser.py` - Used in test scripts

### Successfully Removed
1. `official_mcp_server.py` - Unused duplicate of mcp_sdk_clean.py
2. `start_server.py` - Deprecated, archived to preserve history

## Impact Assessment
- **Technical debt reduced**: Removed 2 unused files
- **Deployment size**: Minimal reduction (files were small)
- **Clarity improved**: Clearer which servers are active
- **Risk mitigation**: Nothing critical removed, all active dependencies preserved

## Preparation for Phase 2
- **FastMCP elimination ready**: All usage patterns documented
- **Server hierarchy clear**: Primary → Fallback → Legacy chain identified
- **Cleanup strategy refined**: Focus on post-FastMCP removal for major gains

## Next Steps (Day 2)
1. Update documentation references to removed files
2. Clean up any remaining deprecated test files
3. Verify all imports still work
4. Prepare handoff to Issue #6 (FastMCP Audit)
