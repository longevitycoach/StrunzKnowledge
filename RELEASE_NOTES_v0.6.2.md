# Release Notes v0.6.2 - Official MCP SDK Migration

**Release Date**: July 17, 2025  
**Version**: 0.6.2  
**Type**: Major Architecture Change  

## 🚀 Major Changes

### Migrated to Official MCP Python SDK
- **Replaced FastMCP** with the official MCP Python SDK from Anthropic
- **Full prompts support** now properly implemented
- **Better Claude.ai compatibility** with native protocol compliance
- **Improved SSE/HTTP transport** for web integration

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Input Validation Errors
- **Issue**: Claude sends arrays as JSON strings like `"[\"forum\"]"`
- **Solution**: Created input parser that handles both formats
- **Affected tools**: `knowledge_search`, `get_trending_insights`, and others with array parameters

### Fixed Vector Store Availability
- **Issue**: "Vector store not available" errors in local environment
- **Solution**: Better error handling and fallback responses
- **Note**: Production server (Railway) has FAISS properly loaded

## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Components
1. **`mcp_sdk_server.py`** - Official SDK implementation
   - Proper `@server.list_prompts()` decorator
   - Native prompt templates support
   - Better error handling

2. **`mcp_input_parser.py`** - Input validation helper
   - Parses JSON string arrays to actual arrays
   - Handles both string and native formats
   - Prevents validation errors

### Architecture Benefits
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP 2025-03-26 support
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with Pydantic
- **Future Proof**: Maintained by Anthropic
- **Better Debugging**: Clear error messages

## ✅ Testing Results

### Local Testing
- ✅ Stdio transport working
- ✅ Input parsing handles all formats
- ✅ Error messages are helpful
- ⚠️ FAISS requires proper setup locally

### Production (Railway)
- ✅ SSE transport operational
- ✅ 43,373 documents loaded
- ✅ All 20 tools available
- ✅ 3 prompts properly registered

## 📝 Migration Impact

### For Users
- **No action required** - Automatic deployment
- **Better reliability** - Fewer "server disabled" errors
- **Same functionality** - All tools work as before

### For Developers
- Use `mcp_sdk_server.py` instead of FastMCP version
- Input validation handled automatically
- Better debugging with official SDK

## 🎯 Why This Change?

FastMCP didn't properly implement the prompts capability in a way that Claude.ai expects. The official SDK:
- Has native prompts support
- Is maintained by Anthropic
- Guarantees protocol compliance
- Provides better SSE/HTTP integration

## 📋 Summary

This release migrates from FastMCP to the official MCP Python SDK to resolve Claude.ai integration issues. The main benefit is proper prompts capability support, which prevents the "server disabled" error.

**Known Issues**: Local FAISS setup still requires manual configuration. Production deployment works correctly.
